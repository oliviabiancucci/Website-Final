# Website-Final
Final assignment for CIS 1050: Web Design &amp; Development

In this final assignment, I was required to create a three page website primarily consisting of original content with external images sourced.

<b>Requirements:</b>
- One main entry page that all other pages can link back to (home.html)
- Two ancillary pages (one.html and two.html)  
- A CSS file to format the contents of the webpages (webstyle.css)
- A 404 error page implemented anywhere in the website (404.html)
